# flowbot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/flowbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gempesaw/flowbot)

This is a Flowdock chatbot that handles some repetitive tasks. It's a
toy project that is an excuse to play with some new ES2015/6/7
features like async/await, the import/export stuff, etc. It uses
[node-flowdock] to interface with Flowdock.
